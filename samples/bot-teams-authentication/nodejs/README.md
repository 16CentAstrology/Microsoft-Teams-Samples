# Teams Auth Bot

Bot Framework v4 bot using Teams authentication

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it shows how to get started with authentication in a bot for Microsoft Teams.

The focus of this sample is how to use the Bot Framework support for oauth in your bot. Teams behaves slightly differently than other channels in this regard. Specifically an Invoke Activity is sent to the bot rather than the Event Activity used by other channels. _This Invoke Activity must be forwarded to the dialog if the OAuthPrompt is being used._ This is done by subclassing the ActivityHandler and this sample includes a reusable TeamsActivityHandler. This class is a candidate for future inclusion in the Bot Framework SDK.

The sample uses the bot authentication capabilities in [Azure Bot Service](https://docs.botframework.com), providing features to make it easier to develop a bot that authenticates users to various identity providers such as Azure AD (Azure Active Directory), GitHub, Uber, etc. The OAuth token is then used to make basic Microsoft Graph queries.

> IMPORTANT: The manifest file in this app adds "token.botframework.com" to the list of `validDomains`. This must be included in any bot that uses the Bot Framework OAuth flow.

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Teams Auth Bot:** [Manifest](/samples/bot-teams-authentication/csharp/demo-manifest/bot-teams-authentication.zip)

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

   ```bash
    # determine node version
    node --version
    ```
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunnelling solution

## Setup

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
> the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1. Register a new application in the [Azure Active Directory â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

2. Setup for Bot
 - Create [Bot Framework registration resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration) in Azure
    - Use the current `https` URL you were given by running ngrok. Append with the path `/api/messages` used by this sample
    - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
    - __*If you don't have an Azure account*__ you can use this [Bot Framework registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/create-a-bot-for-teams#register-your-web-service-with-the-bot-framework)

    > NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

3. Setup NGROK
    - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

	```bash
	# ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
	```   
4. Setup for code

  - Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
  - In a terminal, navigate to `samples\bot-teams-authentication\nodejs` folder

  - Install modules
    
     ```bash
    npm install
    ```
  - Modify the `.env` file in your project folder (or in Visual Studio Code) and fill in below details:
   - `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-TYPE>>` (**Allowed values are: MultiTenant(default), SingleTenant, UserAssignedMSI**)
   - `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` - Generated from Step 1 (Application (client) ID)is the application app id
   - `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-PASSWORD>>` - Generated from Step 14, also referred to as Client secret
   - `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-TENANT-ID>>` - Generated from Step 1(Directory (tenant) ID) is the tenant id
   - `<<YOUR-CONNECTION-NAME>>` -The AAD ConnectionName from the OAuth Connection Settings on Azure Bot registration

  - Run your app

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the `teamsAppManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the MicrosoftAppId may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok.io` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok.io`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `teamsAppManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)
    - Add the app to personal scope or 1:1 chat (Supported scope)

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-teams-authentication/csharp/AdapterWithErrorHandler.cs#L35) line and put your debugger for local debug.
